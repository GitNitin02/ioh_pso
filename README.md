# IOH_PSO

This repository includes all the results of the PSO using three topologies: Star, Ring, and VonNeumann, with a dimensionality of 2 and 5. The experimental settings consisted of two computing platforms: 2ùëë evaluations were performed on an Intel i7 system with 32GB RAM and 8 processing cores, while 5d experiments utilized a more powerful Intel Xeon W-1270P workstation with 96GB RAM and 8 cores to accommodate the increased computational demands of higher-dimensional optimization. The VonNeumann topology took the least time, followed by the Star topology, and the Ring topology took the longest.


This project uses Python 3.11 and requires the libraries listed in the [`requirement.txt`](./requirement.txt) file. The configuration space for the experiment is defined in the [`sample_config.py`](./sample_config.py) file.

A comparison of the three topologies ‚Äî Star, Ring, and Von Neumann ‚Äî is provided in the [`Table.png`](./Table.png)
