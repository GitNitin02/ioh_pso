# ioh_pso
"This repository contains all the results of the PSO using the three topologies Star, Ring and VonNeumann on dim=2. I used an Intel i7 CPU with 32 GB of RAM and 8 cores, which took approximately 8-9 hours approx per topology for 100 runs."

This project uses Python 3.11 and requires the libraries listed in the [`requirement.txt`]([./requirement.txt](https://github.com/GitNitin02/ioh_pso/blob/main/requirement.txt)) file. The configuration space for the experiment is defined in the [`sample_config.py`](./sample_config.py) file.
