# IOH_PSO

This repository includes all the results of the PSO using three topologies: Star, Ring, and VonNeumann, with a dimensionality of 2. The experiments were conducted on an Intel i7 CPU with 32 GB of RAM and 8 cores.The VonNeumann topology took the least time, followed by the Star topology, and the Ring topology took the longest, approximately 8-9 hours for 100 runs.


This project uses Python 3.11 and requires the libraries listed in the [`requirement.txt`](./requirement.txt) file. The configuration space for the experiment is defined in the [`sample_config.py`](./sample_config.py) file.

A comparison of the three topologies — Star, Ring, and Von Neumann — is available in the [`Table of all topologies.pdf`]() folder.
