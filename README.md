# ioh_pso
This repository includes all the results of the PSO using three topologies: Star, Ring, and VonNeumann, with a dimensionality of 2. The experiments were conducted on an Intel i7 CPU with 32 GB of RAM and 8 cores, with each topology taking approximately 8-9 hours for 100 runs.

This project uses Python 3.11 and requires the libraries listed in the [`requirement.txt`](./requirement.txt) file. The configuration space for the experiment is defined in the [`sample_config.py`](./sample_config.py) file.
